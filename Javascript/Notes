there are 4 ways to find output in the JS.

1) InnerHTMl=> we call the element by id and change the content of it.
2)Document.Write=> ovverrides all the data on document and writes on it.

3) == checks only values means if you match number with string it will be true;
4)=== checks values as well as type of the values. (Strictly checks !)

5) ** is used to calculate the exponential of the given number.

6)array in js can store the multiple data at a single time.
7) indices start from zero.
8) cd .. => to go back to the previous folder.
